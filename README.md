- 👋 Hi, I’m @MenyePy
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, mainly stuff related to web dev (front- & back-end), and also Python, because I use it a LOT lately.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about PHP and also how to make good-looking Python GUI's.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. As long as i have the skills to do it.
- 📫 How to reach me? I am on discord, Menye#7290.

- 💖 Thank you for coming by!😉 (also I am interested in minetest but that's by the way...)
